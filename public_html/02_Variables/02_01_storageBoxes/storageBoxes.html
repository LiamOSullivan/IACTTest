        A <b>variable</b> is like a <b>boxes</b> for storing data.<br>
        A variable is first <b>declared</b> before being used. This effectively 'creates the box'.<br>
        A variable declared in a <b>code block</b> loses its value when the block statements have all been <b>executed</b>.<br>
