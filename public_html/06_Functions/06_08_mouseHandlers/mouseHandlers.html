        <h1>Mouse Handler Functions </h1>

        <h2>How it Works:</h2>
        <p>
            This modifies the <a href="../../05_Motion/05_07_followMouse/followMouse.html">Follow Mouse</a> example
            to move the circle position to where the mouse is pressed, only when it is pressed.<br>
            Also, weâ€™ll  change the colour when the mouse is dragged, that is pressed AND moved.<br>
            This uses the <b>mousePressed()</b> and <b>mouseDragged()</b>functions, which are called when those actions are performed with the mouse.<br>
            Any actions we wish to happen when these events occur can be placed in these function.<br>
