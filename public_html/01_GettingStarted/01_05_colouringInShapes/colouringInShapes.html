        <H1>Colouring In Shapes</H1>
        <p>Shapes can be filled with a colour.<br> 
            Here, a black square is drawn on a white canvas background.<br>
            A grey circle is also drawn.<br>
            Finally, a rectangle is drawn with no fill colour, so that the background color can be seen.<br></p>        
        <h2>How it works:</h2>
        <p>The canvas is coloured white using <b>background()</b>. The number for <b>white</b> is <b>255</b><br>
            The colour used to paint a shape is set using the <b>fill()</b> function.<br>
            You can think of this as putting your paintbrush in a particular paint colour, before starting to paint the shape.<br>
            So <b>fill()</b> is called <b>BEFORE</b> the shape is drawn.<br>
            Like <b>background()</b>, colour is set using a number as an argument. So to colour the square black, <b>fill(0)</b> is used. <br>
            The <b>rect()</b> function is used to draw squares and rectangles, its <b>arguments</b> work like <b>ellipse()</b>: <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>width</b>, <b>height</b>.<br>
            After drawing the square and before drawing the circle, the fill colour must be changed to grey. Think of dipping your paintbrush in a new colour.<br>
            If the number 0 is <b>black</b> and 255 is <b>white</b>, grey is some number in-between. Try putting 125 in the second <b>fill()</b> function.<br>
            The circle is then drawn with the fill colour grey.
            to draw a shape that is transparent (has no colour), you can use <b>noFill()</b>. It's like cleaning your paintbrush!<br>
            A rectangle can be drawn using <b>rect()</b>, this time by setting different values for <b>width</b> and <b>height</b>.<br>
        </p>
