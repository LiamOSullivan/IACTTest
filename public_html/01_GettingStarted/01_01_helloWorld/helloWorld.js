/* This sketch has multiple statements. Each ends in a semicolon. Statements are executed in order,
 from top to bottom. Each statement contains a function, which carries out a particular task.
 Functions are recognisable as the function name is followed by a set of parentheses (regular brackets).
 Arguments are provided to functions to tell them how to implement their tasks; if a function takes
 multiple arguments, they are seperated by commas.*/

//Print to the browser console
//console.log("Hello World!");
