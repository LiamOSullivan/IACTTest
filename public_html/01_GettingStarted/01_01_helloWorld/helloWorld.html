        <h1> Hello World </h1>
        <p> Prints the common 'Hello World' phrase to the console window. </p>        
        <h2>How it works: </h2>
        <p>This sketch has multiple <b>statements</b>. Each ends in a <b>semicolon</b>: <b>;</b>.<br> 
           Statements are executed in order, from top to bottom. <br>
           Each statement here contains a <b>function call</b>, which carries out a particular task.<br>
           Functions are recognizable as the function name is followed by a set of <b>parentheses</b> (regular brackets).<br>
            <b>Arguments</b> are provided to functions within the brackets, to tell the function how to carry out their tasks.<br>
            If a function takes multiple arguments, they are separated by a <b>comma</b>. </p>
        <p>In this case, the message to be printed out is surrounded in <b>double quotes</b> <br>
            This says that the message should be printed exactly as it appears; it is a <b>literal</b>.</p>
