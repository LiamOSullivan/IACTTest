        <H1>Colouring Outlines</H1>
        <p>Outlines can be drawn around shapes, of varying colour and thickness.<br> 
            Here, a white square with a black outline is drawn on a grey canvas.<br>
            A thick white circle outline with no fill colour is also drawn..<br>
            Finally, a white rectangle is drawn with no outline.<br></p>        
        <h2>How it works:</h2>
        <p>The canvas is coloured grey this time.<br>
            The outline colour is set to black using the <b>stroke()</b> function. Just like <b>fill()</b> the number supplied sets the colour.<br> 
            (The default outline colour is black, so if <b>stroke()</b> is not called, this will be used). <br>
            The thickness of the outline is set by <b>strokeWeight()</b> which again must be called <b>BEFORE</b> the shape is drawn.<br>
            Think of it as choosing a fatter or thinner paint brush.<br>
            The order of <b>stroke()</b> and <b>strokeWeight()</b> don't matter, once they are both called before the shape is drawn.<br>
            After drawing the square with a black outline, <b>noFill()</b> is used before the circle, the outline colour is set to white,  and the stroke weight is increased.<br>
            Finally, the rectangle is drawn using <b>noStroke()</b>, so it appears without an outline.<br>
