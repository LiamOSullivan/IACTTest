/* This sketch has multiple statements. Each ends in a semicolon. Statements are executed in order,
 from top to bottom. Each statement contains a function, which carries out a particular task.
 Functions are recognisable as the function name is followed by a set of parentheses (regular brackets).
 Arguments are provided to functions to tell them how to implement their tasks; if a function takes
 multiple arguments, they are seperated by commas.
 
 The Processing help can tell you how to use a function properly- highlight the function name and go to
 'Help>Find in reference.'

//it is treated like a comment and ignored as we don't need it, but want to leave it in the code for now).
