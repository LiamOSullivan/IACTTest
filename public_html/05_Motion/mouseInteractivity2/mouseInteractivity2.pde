 /* This modifies the Mouse Interactivity 1 sketch to move 
 the circle position to where the mouse is pressed, only 
 when it is pressed. Also, weâ€™ll only change the colour when 
 the mouse is pressed.
 
 This uses the mousePressed() function, which is called when a
 mouse button is pressed. Any actions we wich to happen when 
 this event occurs can be placed in this function.
